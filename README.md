# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction


The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the compressive strength of concrete. The model takes into account the composition of different components (e.g., cement, slag, fly ash), water content, age, and other factors to make predictions.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here]([link_to_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data)). It includes information about the composition of concrete mixtures and the corresponding compressive strength values.


     
## Key Steps
1. Data Exploration: Loading the dataset and explored to understand its structure and identify any data issues.
2. Data Preprocessing: Steps such as handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature engineering are performed.
3. Model Training: Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Lasso Regression, are trained.
4. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared (R^2) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Visualization: Visualizations, including scatter plots and histograms, are used to analyze and present the results.
6. Observations: Insights and observations about model performance and feature importance are provided.
